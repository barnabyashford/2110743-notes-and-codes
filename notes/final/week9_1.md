# Computational Learning Theory

Synopsis: Thoery that helps you approximate how many datapoints needed to make a learner that is good enough

What general laws constrain inductive learning?

- Probability of successful learning
- Number of training example
- Complexity of hypothesis space
- Accuracy of target concept
- How one present examples

## Let's talk concept learning

**Given**:

-
