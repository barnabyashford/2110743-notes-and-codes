# Bayesian Learning (2)

## Relation to Concept Learning

Consider our usual concept learning task

- instance space $X$, hypothesis space $H$, training examples $D$
- consider the $FindS$ learning algorithm (outputs most specific hypothesis from the version space $VS_{H,D}$)

What would Bayes rule produce as the $MAP$ hypothesis?

Does $FindS$ output a $MAP$ hypothesis?

Assume fixed set of instances
