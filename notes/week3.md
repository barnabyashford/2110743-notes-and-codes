## A Tree to predict C-Section risk

Learned from medical records of 1000 women. Negative examples are C-sections.

## Decision Trees

Decision tree representation:

- Each internal node tests an attribute
- Each branch corresponds to attribute value
- Each leaf node assigns a classification

How would we represent:

- $\land$, $\lor$, $XOR$
- $(A \land B) \lor (C \land \neg D \land E)
- $M$ of $N$

### When to Consider Decision Trees

- Instances describable by attribute-value pairs
- Target function is discrete valued
- Disjunctive hypothesis may be required
- Possibly noisy training data

Examples:

- Equipment or medical diagnosis
- Credit risk analysis
- Modeling calendar scheduling preferences

### Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees

**Main loop**:

1. $A$ &larr; the "best" decision attribute for next $node$
2. Assign $A$ as decision attribute for $node$
3. For each value of $A$, create new descendant of $node$
4. Sort training examples to leaf nodes
5. If training examples perfectly classified, Then STOP, Else iterate over new leaf nodes

**Which attribute is best?**

<img width="501" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 06 02 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/336258dd-eb20-4c9a-8fb6-dd4bb224354c" />

Probably `A1`, as the descendant nodes are more biased to either positive or negative examples, hinting the attribute's ability to separate data in a near-seamless manner.

### Entropy

<img width="307" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 06 04 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5587b9-905a-438f-8b5e-2b9b37db36fe" />

- $S$ is a sample of training examples
- $p_\oplus$ is the proportion of positive examples in $S$
- $p_\ominus$ is the proportion of negative examples in $S$
- Entropy measures the impurity of S

$$ Entropy(S) \equiv -p_\oplus log_2 p_\oplus -p_\ominus log_2 p_\ominus $$

From the distribution graph, we can see that $Entropy(\cdot)$ can be as low as 0 and as high as 1. The way it increase or decrease is up to the proportion of the data, where the more biased the data is, the lower it gets, the less bias the data is, the higher it gets. If the data contains only members of a single class, $Entropy(\cdot)$ drops to zero, while if classes are balanced, $Entropy(\cdot)$ go right up to one.

$Entropy(S)$ = expected number of bits needed to encode class ($\oplus$ or $\ominus$) of randomly drawn member of $S$ (under the optimal, shortest-length code)

Why?

Information theory: optimal length code assigns

- $log_2 p$ bits to message having probability $p$.

So, expected number of bits to encode $\oplus$ or $\ominus$ of random member of $S$:

$$ p_\oplus (-log_2 p_\oplus) + -p_\ominus (-log_2 p_\ominus) $$

$$ Entropy(S) \equiv -p_\oplus log_2 p_\oplus -p_\ominus log_2 p_\ominus $$

### Information Gain

$Gain(S,A)$ = expected reduction in entropy due to sorting on $A$

$$ Gain(S,A) \equiv Entropy(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)}\frac{|S_v|}{|S|}Entropy(S_v) $$

<img width="501" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 06 02 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/336258dd-eb20-4c9a-8fb6-dd4bb224354c" />

### Selecting the Next Attribute

<img width="559" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 07 25 05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e98d577-2d31-42a9-8170-82025629546e" />

$$ Gain(S_{Sunny},Humidity) = .970 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)0.0 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)0.0 = .970 $$

$$ Gain(S_{Sunny},Temperature) = .970 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)0.0 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)1.0 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)1.0 = .570 $$

$$ Gain(S_{Sunny},Wind) = .970 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)1.0 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right).918 = .019 $$

## Hypothesis Space Search by ID3

<img width="477" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 07 34 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5a45795-42dd-4ded-be9e-94e910a0661f" />

- Hypothesis space is complete!
  - Target function surely in there...
- Outputs a single hypothesis (which one?)
  - Can't play 20 questions...
- No back tracking
  - Local minima...
- Statisically-based search choices
  - Robust to noisy data...
- Inductive bias: approx "prefer shortest tree"

### Inductive Bias in ID3

Note $H$ is the power set of instances $X$

&rarr; Unbiased?

Not really...
- Preference for short trees, and for those with high information gain attributes near the root
- Bias is a $preference$ for some hypotheses, rather than a $restriction$ of hypothesis space $H$
- Occam's razor: prefer the shortest hypothesis that fits the data

### Occam's Razor

Why prefer short hypotheses?

Argument in favor:

- Fewer short hyps. than long hyps.
  - a short hyp that fits data unlikely to be coincidence
  - a long hyp that fits data might be coincidence

Argument opposed:

- There are many ways to define small sets of hyps
- e.g., all trees with a prime number of nodes that use attributes beginning with "Z"
- What's so special about small sets based on $size$ of hypothesis??

## Overfitting in Decision Trees

Consider adding noisy training example #15:

$$ Sunny, Hot, Normal, Strong, PlayTennis = No $$

What effect on earlier tree?

<img width="517" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 05 49 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7827854e-9372-4830-b7cb-eb5256c7bf27" />

Consider error of hypothesis $h$ over

- training data: $error_{train}(h)$
- entire distribution $D$ of data: $error_D(h)$

Hypothesis $h \in H$ overfits training data if there is an alternative hypothesis $h^\prime \in H$ such that

$$ error_{train}(h) < error_{train}(h^\prime) $$

and

$$ error_D(h) < error_D(h^\prime) $$

<img width="552" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 07 45 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a81d862-aa83-40f2-9b5b-f13fe5c057e3" />

### Avoiding Overfitting

How can we avoid overfitting?

- stop growing when data split not statistically significant
- grow full tree, then post-prune

How to select "best" tree:

- Measure performance over training data
- Measure performance over separate validation data set
- MDL: minimize

$$ size(tree) + size(misclassifications(tree)) $$

## Reduced-Error Pruning

Split data into $training$ and $validation$ set

Do until further pruning is harmful:

1. Evaluate impact on $validation$ set of pruning each possible node (plus those below it)
2. Greedily remove the one that most improves $validation$ set accuracy

- produces smallest version of most accurate subtree
- What if data is limited?

**Effect of Reduced-Error Pruning**

<img width="513" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 07 49 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b849c7b-b18f-4ba9-b6cd-d8ed82f20ab1" />

## Rule Post-Pruning

1. Convert tree to equivalent set of rules
2. Prune each rule independently of others
3. Sort final rules into desired sequence for use

Perhaps most frequently used method (e.g., C4.5)

## Converting a Tree to Rules

<img width="517" alt="Screenshot 2568-03-02 at 05 49 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7827854e-9372-4830-b7cb-eb5256c7bf27" />

$\text{IF } (Outlook = Sunny) \land (Humidity = High)$  
$\text{THEN } PlayTennis = No$

$\text{IF } (Outlook = Sunny) \land (Humidity = Normal)$  
$\text{THEN } PlayTennis = Yes$

$\cdots$

## Continuous Valued Attributes

Create a discrete attribute to test continuous

- $Temperature$ = 82.5
- ($Temperature$ > 72.3) = $t$, $f$

| Attriburte | Value | Value | Value | Value | Value | Value |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $Temperature$: | 40 | 48 | 60 | 72 | 80 | 90 |
| $PlayTennis$: | $No$ | $No$ | $Yes$ | $Yes$ | $Yes$ | $No$ |

## Attribures with Many Values

Problem:

- If attribute has many values, Gain will select it
- Imagine using Date = Jun_3_1996 as attribute

One approach: use Gain Ratio instead

$$ GainRatio(S,A) = \frac{Gain(S,A)}{SplitInformation(S,A)} $$

$$ SplitInformation(S,A) \equiv -\sum_{i=1}^{c}\frac{|S_i|}{|S|}log_2\frac{|S_i|}{|S|}

where $S_i$ is subset of $S$ for which $A$ has value $v_i$

## Attributes with Costs

Consider

- medical diagnosis, $BloodTest$ has cost $150
- robotics, $Width-from_1ft$ has cost 23 sec.

How to learn a consistent tree with low expected cost?

One approach: replace gain by

- Tan and Schlimmer (1990)

$$ \frac{Gain(S,A)}{Cost(A)} $$

- Nunez (1988)

$$ \frac{2^{Gain(S,A)} - 1}{(Cost (A) + 1)^w} $$

where $w \in [0,1]$ determines importance of cost

## Unknown Attivute Values

What if some examples missing values of $A$? Use training example anyway, sort through tree

- If node $n$ tests $A$, assign most common value of $A$ among other examples sorted to node $n$
- assign most common value of $A$ among other examples with same target value
- assign probability $p_i$ to each possible value $v_i$ of $A$
-   assign fraction $p_i$ of example to each descendant in tree

Classify new examples in same fashion
